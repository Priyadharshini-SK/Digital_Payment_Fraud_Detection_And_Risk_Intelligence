# Digital Payment Fraud Detection & Risk Intelligence

This Power BI project analyzes digital payment fraud patterns and risk indicators to support
data-driven fraud prevention and decision-making.

The project is designed with three interactive dashboards, each targeting a specific
business audience.

## Dashboard 1 – Executive Fraud Overview
Provides a high-level summary of fraud performance for management:
- Total Transactions, Fraud Transactions, Fraud Percentage, and Total Amount
- Bank-wise fraud distribution (Sender & Receiver banks)
- Time-based fraud trend analysis

👉 Used by senior management for quick monitoring and strategic decisions.

## Dashboard 2 – Fraud Pattern & Risk Analysis
Focuses on identifying fraud behavior and risk patterns:
- Fraud by transaction type (P2P, P2M, Bill Payment, Recharge)
- Weekend vs Weekday fraud comparison
- Hour-wise fraud activity analysis
- Fraud distribution by transaction amount range

👉 Used by risk and operations teams to detect suspicious patterns.

## Dashboard 3 – Customer & Risk Intelligence
Analyzes fraud from a customer and device perspective:
- Fraud transactions by sender age group
- Device-based fraud analysis (Android, iOS, Web)
- State-wise fraud concentration using map visuals
- Risk threshold comparison using gauge visualization

👉 Used for targeted fraud prevention and customer risk profiling.

## Key Insights
- Majority of fraud transactions originate from Android devices due to wider usage.
- Specific age groups and regions show higher fraud concentration.
- Fraud activity peaks during certain hours and transaction types.
